# SQL Data Analysis Assignment – Task 3

## 📌 Internship Task
This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship** at Adrovix Technologies  where I created a small database and performed SQL data analysis using different queries.

The goal of this task was to practice important SQL concepts such as:
- SELECT
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- JOIN
- ORDER BY
- Aggregate Functions

# 📊 SQL Concepts Demonstrated
This project includes multiple SQL queries such as:

- Data retrieval using **SELECT**
- Filtering records using **WHERE**
- Aggregating data using **GROUP BY**
- Sorting results using **ORDER BY**
- Using aggregate functions like **COUNT, SUM, AVG**
